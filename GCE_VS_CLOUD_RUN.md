# Architecture Upgrade: GCE VMs → Cloud Run Jobs

## Why We Switched

The original plan called for using Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machines to run patent searches. However, **Cloud Run Jobs provides a superior serverless solution** with significant advantages.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | GCE VM (Original Plan) | Cloud Run Jobs (Current) | Winner |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Cost (100 searches/month)** | ~$24/month | ~$1.50/month | 🏆 Cloud Run |
| **Idle Cost** | Pays 24/7 even when unused | $0 when not running | 🏆 Cloud Run |
| **Scaling** | Manual (need to provision VMs) | Auto-scales automatically | 🏆 Cloud Run |
| **Maintenance** | SSH, OS updates, security patches | Zero maintenance | 🏆 Cloud Run |
| **Deployment** | Complex (SSH, scripts, pm2) | Simple (Docker container) | 🏆 Cloud Run |
| **Monitoring** | Manual setup required | Built-in Cloud Logging | 🏆 Cloud Run |
| **Cold Start** | Always warm | ~2-5 seconds | ⚖️ GCE |
| **Max Runtime** | Unlimited | 60 minutes max | ⚖️ GCE |
| **Setup Complexity** | High | Medium | 🏆 Cloud Run |

**Winner:** Cloud Run Jobs by a landslide! ✨

## Cost Breakdown

### GCE VM Approach (Original)
```
e2-medium instance: $24.27/month (running 24/7)
Storage: $0.50/month
Total: ~$24.77/month
```

**Even if you only run 10 searches per month, you still pay $24.77!**

### Cloud Run Jobs Approach (Current)
```
Compute: $0.01 per search × 100 searches = $1.00
Storage: $0.50/month
Total: ~$1.50/month
```

**Savings: 94% cost reduction! 💰**

### Cost per Search Comparison
- **GCE:** $0.25 per search (for 100 searches/month)
- **Cloud Run:** $0.01 per search
- **Savings:** 96% per search!

## Architecture Comparison

### Original GCE Architecture
```
Vercel (Frontend)
    ↓ API call
Next.js API (Compute Engine API)
    ↓ SSH command or startup script
GCE VM (always running)
    ↓ Executes get_patents.js
Cloud Storage
```

**Problems:**
- VM runs 24/7 (wasting money)
- Need to manage OS, security, updates
- Complex deployment (SSH, scripts)
- Single point of failure
- Can't auto-scale

### Current Cloud Run Jobs Architecture
```
Vercel (Frontend)
    ↓ API call
Next.js API (Cloud Run Jobs API)
    ↓ Trigger job execution
Cloud Run Job (starts container)
    ↓ Runs get_patents.js
    ↓ Shuts down when done
Cloud Storage
```

**Benefits:**
- Only runs when needed
- Zero infrastructure management
- Simple Docker deployment
- Auto-scales to handle multiple searches
- Pay per second of execution

## Technical Implementation Changes

### What Changed in the Code

#### 1. API Route (`app/api/start-search/route.ts`)

**Before (GCE):**
```typescript
import { Compute } from "@google-cloud/compute";

const compute = new Compute({ projectId, credentials });
const vm = compute.zone(zone).vm(vmName);

// Complex VM command execution
await vm.executeCommand(command);
```

**After (Cloud Run Jobs):**
```typescript
import { JobsClient } from "@google-cloud/run";

const runClient = new JobsClient({ projectId, credentials });

// Simple job execution
await runClient.runJob({
  name: `projects/${projectId}/locations/${location}/jobs/${jobName}`,
  overrides: {
    containerOverrides: [{
      env: [
        { name: "JOB_ID", value: jobId },
        { name: "SEARCH_TERMS_JSON", value: JSON.stringify(searchTerms) }
      ]
    }]
  }
});
```

**Much cleaner!** ✨

#### 2. Worker Script (`get_patents.js`)

**Before (GCE):**
- Needed to handle command-line arguments
- Required pm2 or similar for process management
- Had to manage node_modules on VM

**After (Cloud Run Jobs):**
- Uses environment variables (cleaner)
- Containerized (all dependencies included)
- Automatic process management

#### 3. New Files Added

- **`Dockerfile`** - Container definition
- **`.dockerignore`** - Optimize container size
- **`worker-package.json`** - Worker dependencies
- **`CLOUD_RUN_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide

## Deployment Comparison

### GCE VM Deployment Process
1. Create VM
2. SSH into VM
3. Install Node.js
4. Upload scripts
5. Install dependencies
6. Configure startup scripts
7. Set up monitoring
8. Configure firewall rules
9. Set up SSH keys
10. Manage security updates

**Time:** ~1-2 hours  
**Complexity:** High  
**Maintenance:** Ongoing

### Cloud Run Jobs Deployment Process
1. Create Cloud Storage bucket
2. Create service accounts
3. Build Docker container (`gcloud builds submit`)
4. Create Cloud Run Job (`gcloud run jobs create`)
5. Done!

**Time:** ~20 minutes  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Maintenance:** Zero

## When to Use Each

### Use GCE VMs When:
- ❌ You need jobs longer than 60 minutes
- ❌ You have steady, predictable workload 24/7
- ❌ You need direct SSH access
- ❌ You're running a persistent service (not batch jobs)

### Use Cloud Run Jobs When:
- ✅ You run sporadic, on-demand workloads
- ✅ Job duration is under 60 minutes
- ✅ You want to minimize costs
- ✅ You want zero infrastructure management
- ✅ You need auto-scaling

**For our patent search use case: Cloud Run Jobs is perfect!** 🎯

- ✅ Frontend code (no changes needed)
- ✅ Search status page (no changes needed)
- ✅ get_patents.js core logic (minimal changes)
- ✅ Cloud Storage integration (identical)
- ✅ User experience (exactly the same)

### What Changed
- ✅ API route now uses Cloud Run client
- ✅ Worker gets config from env vars
- ✅ Added Docker containerization
- ✅ Simpler deployment process
- ✅ Better cost efficiency

### What Got Better

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Light User (10 searches/month)
- **GCE:** $24.77/month
- **Cloud Run:** $0.60/month
- **Savings:** $24.17/month = **97% cheaper!**

### Scenario 2: Medium User (100 searches/month)
- **GCE:** $24.77/month
- **Cloud Run:** $1.50/month
- **Savings:** $23.27/month = **94% cheaper!**

### Scenario 3: Heavy User (500 searches/month)
- **GCE:** $24.77/month (need multiple VMs, so ~$75/month)
- **Cloud Run:** $6.00/month (auto-scales)
- **Savings:** $69/month = **92% cheaper!**

**Cloud Run Jobs wins in EVERY scenario!** 🏆
