## Notes & Decisions

- Using Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
- Using shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4
- Opted for standard build (not Turbopack) during initialization
- Environment variables configured for Google Gemini and Google Cloud Platform
- Added shadcn components: Button, Input, Badge, Sonner, Popover
- Implemented color-coded badges for different term types (device=blue, technology=green, subject=purple)
- Editor uses TipTap with StarterKit extension
- Using Gemini Pro for description generation and term extraction
- Using Gemini 2.5 Pro for related terms generation
- Sonner toast library chosen over shadcn toast (better compatibility)
- Added lucide-react for icons throughout UI
- Implemented comprehensive query builder beyond original spec
- **UPGRADED TO CLOUD RUN JOBS:** Switched from GCE VMs to Cloud Run Jobs for:
